ML is the practical implementation of [[Data mining]] and a subarea of [[Artificial intelligence]].
The high-level idea is to use algorithms that can learn from examples aka. past experience, and use a learned function/prediction rule to predict future outcomes. Like learning a function to determine handwritten digits based on images of already labelled handwritten digits.
