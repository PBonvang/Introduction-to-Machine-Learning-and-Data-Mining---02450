**Generalization error:** The evaluation score of the model on previously unseen data.  

**Test & training error:** The average loss of the model on it's test and training data.

**Model:** A ML model is the term for the setup that learns the prediction rule. It's the preprocessing/validation transformations, the training and the testing. It's to say the system around the learned function, including the learned function.

**Flexibility:** The more flexible a model is the more sophisticated functions it's able to learn. For [[Artificial Neural Networks - ANN]]s this is usually achieved by putting more neurons in the network.
