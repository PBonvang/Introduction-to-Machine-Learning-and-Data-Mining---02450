Ensemble methods refer to the idea of using training multiple models and using their predictions as a collective classification. Like get the opinion of multiple doctors and specialists, then collectively give a diagnose.

This collective prediction is especially more accurate when the different models are trained differently. 
Methods for varying the models include:
- Apply different transformations to the training set, for instance images can be rotated or translated. Often used for classification of images
- Select a subset of features. Often used for [[Classification trees|Decision trees]] and [[Random forest]]
- Re-sample subsets of the training set. Used for [[Bagging]] and [[Boosting]]
